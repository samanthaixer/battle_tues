# The Battle

## The project

This project creates a very basic battle game where 2 players can attack each other.

The players take turns and cause each other damage (reducing the hit points).

As the game is as simple as that, player 2 will always lose.

## Technologies used

- RSpec and Capybara for testing
- Sinatra for the web app
- Ruby for the classes in the Model layer

## Features still to implement

- Change the global variable $game to something better - the last step of the basic challenge
- Stopping the game when one of the players reaches 0. At the moment it just displays a message and allows the players to continue attacking each other
- Any further advanced steps to make the game more competitive

## Installing the project

- `git clone git@github.com:samanthaixer/battle_tues.git`
- `bundle install`

## Testing the project

- From the root directory, run `rspec`

## Running the app

- `rackup -p 4567` will run the app on port 4567
- Go to `http://localhost:4567` to start using the app
- **beware** the currently hideous styling - I am still trying to work out how to use CSS

## Approach

This project was completed in the afternoons of Week 3. I started the project with Kim and compeleted it to this stage on my own. I have sometimes used the walkthrough but tried to do it myself towards the latter stages of the challenge.

I haven't yet fully checked for single responsibility or checked that the code and tests are DRY.
